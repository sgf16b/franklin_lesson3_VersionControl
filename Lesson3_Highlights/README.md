## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Reserved words- Reserved words are words in JavaScript that users cannot use as their variable, label, or function names. In other words, reserved words, or keywords, are words that users cannot use when naming variables, functions, objects, properties, methods, and events in their code.
2. Comments- In JavaScript, comments are statements that the user creates in order to guide themselves through their program. Comments can be used in a user’s code to provide information or an explanation for a variable, method, or class. Comments are statements in the code that aren’t compiled, or interpreted, by the computer. When JavaScript executes the code, the comments are completely ignored.
3. Version Control System- The formal definition of a version control system is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of the program or software. To explain it simply, a version control system, or VCS, is the single main storage space for all of the web designer’s project files.
