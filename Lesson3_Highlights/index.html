            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The formal definition of a version control system is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of the program or software. To explain it simply, a version control system, or VCS, is the single main storage space for all of the web designer’s project files. A version control system allows the web designer to keep a record of all the changes that have been made to a file or series of files. This in turn gives the web designer the ability to go back to specific changes that have been previously made to the file or set of files. This topic interests me because version control systems make life easier for me as a web designer. A lot of times when I am working on web designs, I hit road blocks. The version control system will allow me to identify all of the changes I have made to my file, or files, in the past so that I can essentially retrace my steps. This topic is relevant to this course because it is a very useful part of working with files in Cloud9 and GitHub. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository, or storage space, that resides on a local machine of an individual user. In other words, a local repository is a storage space where users can make local changes. Typically, this local repository is on the computer. The local repository is usually on the user’s computer, and contains all of the files and their commit history. There are two different ways a web designer could make a local repository. First, one could create a brand new repository. Second, one could clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. Local Git commands include git add and git commit. This topic interests me because we use a local repository in class every day, Cloud9. This topic is relevant to our course because Cloud9 would be an example of a local repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository, or storage space, that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple members of a team. Remote Rrepositories can also be described as versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. When working with group members, the remote repository allows you to add repositories, remove repositories that are not valid anymore, and manage remote branches. Additionally, managing remote repositories calls for the pushing and pulling of data. Two examples of a remote Git command would include git push and git pull. A unique aspect of remote repositories is that you can push, pull/fetch, add, inspect, remove, and rename them. This topic interests me because we have started to use a remote repository in class, GitHub. The topic of remote repositories is relevant to our course because GitHub would be an example of a remote repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Comments</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In JavaScript, comments are statements that the user creates in order to guide themselves through their program. Comments can be used in a user’s code to provide information or an explanation for a variable, method, or class. Comments are statements in the code that aren’t compiled, or interpreted, by the computer. When JavaScript executes the code, the comments are completely ignored. Additionally, there are two different forms of comments in JavaScript. One form of comment is a block comment. A block comment begins with /* and ends with */. The second type of comment is a single line comment. A single line comment is indicated by two forward slashes (//). This topic interests me because comments are a very useful tool for any web designer when composing code. Comments are relevant to our course because they can be used when writing code and designing web pages. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Reserved Words</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Reserved words are words in JavaScript that users cannot use as their variable, label, or function names. In other words, reserved words, or keywords, are words that users cannot use when naming variables, functions, objects, properties, methods, and events in their code. The names given to these components of code are known as identifiers. There are numerous known reserved words in JavaScript. Some examples of reserved words in JavaScript include abstract, switch, int, interface, return, short, catch, double, float, implements, super, and many more. The best way to avoid incorporating reserved words in code include using meaningful names for identifiers. Another way to avoid reserved words is by including camel casing and/or underscores. This topic interests me because as I am learning JavaScript in class, it is important that remember how to create identifiers and avoid using reserved words. Reserved words is relevant to our course because when we are developing web pages in class using JavaScript, it is crucial that we don’t run into the problem of using reserved words in our codes. </p>
